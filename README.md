# Stocks
The code implements a simple stock tracker application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing library. The application allows users to enter the name of a stock and retrieve its corresponding price. It supports three predefined stocks: "AAPL" (Apple), "GOOG" (Google), and "TSLA" (Tesla).

When the program is executed, a window titled "Stock Tracker" is displayed. The user interface consists of a text field where the user can enter a stock name and a "Get Price" button to retrieve the stock's price.

When the user clicks the "Get Price" button, the entered stock name is retrieved from the text field. The code then searches for the stock name in the predefined stocks array. If a match is found, it displays a message dialog showing the corresponding price for that stock. If no match is found, it displays a "Stock not found" message.

Overall, the code provides a simple way for users to track the prices of specific stocks through a user-friendly GUI.
